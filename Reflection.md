- skills section is used to list my multiple skills
- Experience section for my past experience and work
- Contact information includes my personal information to contact me 
- Images include my profile picture and my hand made paintings

- Then divided the section like about me, skills, experience and contact information into different section.
- add my images to it to make more professional
